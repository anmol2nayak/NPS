Step 1: Setting Up the Network Topology
- Add two Cisco switches and several PCs in Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Connect PCs to switches and link the two switches together using appropriate cables.

Step 2: Configuring VLANs
- Create two VLANs (e.g., Sales and Engineering) on the switches.
- Assign names to the VLANs.

Step 3: Assigning Ports to VLANs
- Assign specific switch ports to each VLAN to group PCs accordingly.

Step 4: Configuring Trunking Between Switches
- Configure trunking on the switch ports that connect the two switches to allow multiple VLANs to communicate.

Step 5: Testing Connectivity
- Assign IP addresses to PCs within the VLAN subnets.
- Test connectivity by pinging between PCs within the same VLAN.
