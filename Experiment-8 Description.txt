To configure RIP and OSPF using Cisco Packet Tracer, follow these detailed steps:

Prerequisites:
Cisco Packet Tracer installed.
Basic understanding of IP addressing and subnetting.
Knowledge of routing protocols (RIP and OSPF).

Step-by-Step Guide:
Step 1: Network Setup
1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Create a network topology:
   - Drag and drop at least two routers, three switches, and several end devices (PCs or laptops) onto the workspace.
   - Connect the routers to each other using Serial or Ethernet cables (crossover or straight-through, depending on the interface).
   - Connect the switches to the routers using Ethernet cables.
   - Connect end devices (PCs) to the switches.

Step 2: Assign IP Addresses
1. Assign IP addresses to all router interfaces:
   - Double-click on each router to access the CLI or use the Config tab.
   - Assign IP addresses to the interfaces that are connected to other routers and switches. For example:
     
     Router0(config)interface gigabitEthernet 0/0
     Router0(config-if)ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
     Router0(config-if)no shutdown
     
     Router0(config)interface gigabitEthernet 0/1
     Router0(config-if)ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
     Router0(config-if)no shutdown
     
2. Assign IP addresses to PCs:
   - Configure the PCs with static IP addresses in the same subnet as their respective routers.

Step 3: Configure RIP Routing
1. Enable RIP on each router:
   - Enter the router’s CLI and configure the RIP routing process:
     
     Router0(config)router rip
     Router0(config-router)version 2
     Router0(config-router)network 192.168.1.0
     Router0(config-router)network 192.168.2.0
     Router0(config-router)no auto-summary
     
   - Repeat this step on all routers, specifying the networks that are directly connected to each router.

Step 4: Verify RIP Configuration
1. Check the routing table:
   - Use the command show ip route on each router to verify that RIP routes have been learned.
2. Test connectivity:
   - Ping between the PCs to ensure they can communicate with each other. If successful, the RIP configuration is functioning correctly.

Step 5: Configure OSPF Routing
1. Remove RIP configuration (if needed):
   - If you want to switch to OSPF, first disable RIP on the routers:
     
     Router0(config)no router rip
     
2. Enable OSPF on each router:
   - Enter the router’s CLI and configure the OSPF routing process:
     
     Router0(config)router ospf 1
     Router0(config-router)network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
     Router0(config-router)network 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
     
   - The number "1" in router ospf 1 is the OSPF process ID, which can be any number but must be the same across all routers.
   - The area 0 indicates the OSPF backbone area.

Step 6: Verify OSPF Configuration
1. Check the routing table:
   - Use the command show ip route to see OSPF routes on each router.
2. Verify OSPF neighbors:
   - Use the command show ip ospf neighbor to ensure that the routers have established OSPF adjacency.
3. Test connectivity:
   - Ping between the PCs to confirm that they can communicate with each other.

Step 7: Troubleshooting
1. Common issues and solutions:
   - Incorrect IP addresses: Double-check IP assignments on routers and PCs.
   - Interface down: Make sure interfaces are up with the no shutdown command.
   - Routing protocol configuration errors: Verify the network statements under RIP or OSPF configuration.

Additional Tips
- Use no auto-summary in RIP configuration to disable automatic route summarization.
- In OSPF, ensure all routers are in the same area (e.g., area 0) for basic configurations.
- When connecting routers via Serial interfaces, configure the clock rate on the DCE side:
     
     Router0(config-if)clock rate 64000
     
Example Network Topology:
- Router0
  - G0/0 (192.168.1.1/24) – Connected to PC0 (192.168.1.2)
  - G0/1 (192.168.2.1/24) – Connected to Router1
- Router1
  - G0/0 (192.168.2.2/24) – Connected to Router0
  - G0/1 (192.168.3.1/24) – Connected to PC1 (192.168.3.2)

Following these steps should help you successfully configure RIP and OSPF in Cisco Packet Tracer, providing dynamic routing across your network.
