Experiment 10: Configuring Standard and Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Cisco Packet Tracer
Objective
The goal is to set up Standard and Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control network traffic and restrict access based on IP addresses and protocols.

Steps
1. Setup Your Topology
Open Cisco Packet Tracer and add the required devices (e.g., routers, switches, PCs).
Connect devices using appropriate cables, ensuring they are in the correct ports.

2. Configure IP Addresses
Configure IP addresses on each device to ensure they can communicate within the network.
Assign IP addresses to routers' interfaces and end devices as per the network plan.

3. Basic Routing Configuration
Configure routing (if required) to enable communication between different network segments.
You can use static routes or a dynamic routing protocol like RIP or OSPF to ensure all devices can communicate.

4. Configure a Standard Access Control List
Standard ACLs filter traffic based only on source IP addresses.
Use the following commands on the router:
plaintext
Copy code
Router(config)# access-list [ACL Number] permit [Source IP] [Wildcard Mask]
Router(config)# interface [Interface Name]
Router(config-if)# ip access-group [ACL Number] in
Example: To allow traffic from 192.168.1.0 and block others:
plaintext
Copy code
Router(config)# access-list 10 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ip access-group 10 in

5. Configure an Extended Access Control List
Extended ACLs filter traffic based on both source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
Example command:
plaintext
Copy code
Router(config)# access-list [ACL Number] permit [Protocol] [Source IP] [Wildcard Mask] [Destination IP] [Wildcard Mask] eq [Port Number]
Router(config)# interface [Interface Name]
Router(config-if)# ip access-group [ACL Number] in
Example: To allow HTTP traffic from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.2.0:
plaintext
Copy code
Router(config)# access-list 100 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
Router(config-if)# ip access-group 100 in

6. Test and Verify ACL Configuration
Use the ping and traceroute commands to test connectivity.
Verify if the ACLs are correctly restricting access by attempting connections from allowed and blocked IPs.
Use the command show access-lists on the router to view the ACLs and check if they are applied as expected.

7. Documentation and Analysis
Record your configurations and test results.
Analyze the traffic flow and confirm if the ACLs are performing as expected.
